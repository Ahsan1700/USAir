/** 
 * Due to lack of API's that offered US airport names.
 * I used the database that the current lookup API (airportdb.io) was based off of (found here: https://ourairports.com/data/).
 * I parsed through the data using python to create this list of medium and large US airports.
 * P.S. This is used only for the autocomplete and API calls are still used for data.
 * NOTE: The API required the full ICAO Code so some are 3-digit while other are longer
